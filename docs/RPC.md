# RPC
RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call and is supported in MaxOS in the syscore/ipc/rpc.h,.cpp files.
However, calling functions this way between a server and client can be annoying therefore a custom IDL 
(Interface Descriptor Language) has been implemented. To use this place {name}.rpc in the library of choice and the 
buildsystem will autogenerate the stubs for your function, both client and serverside.

Example:
```
package greeting;
version 1.0;
path /greeting/

service greeting_server {

    rpc int64 say_hi(string name);
    rpc (int64, string) compute_answer(uint32 a, uint32 b) [urgent];
    rpc void notify(string message) [oneway];
}

```


- `package <name>;` Defines the group for the services defined in the file
- `version <v>;` Indicates what spec of the rpc file format this package compiles with
- `path <path>;` Defines the path to generate the files. Header will be placed in 'include/{path}/{name}.h' and source files will be placed in  'include/{path}/{name}.h'
- `service <service_name> { ... }` Defines an endpoint where the specified functions will exist on
- `rpc <return> <method>(arglist) [flags];` Defines an RPC function that can be called

When changing the .rpc file, make sure to run "make rpc"  to ensure the autogenerated files are updated.

TODO: DOC more (types, flags), support non include/ and src/ layouts
