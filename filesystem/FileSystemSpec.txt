MaxOS follows a unix like FS with slight changes

Some of the changes are:
lib32, and lib64 are merged into lib
there are no system folders, everything is in / or /usr



/ is the root directory
subdirectories of /:
bin   - contains all the binaries
boot  - contains the boot files
dev   - contains the devices
etc   - contains the configuration files (global)
home  - contains the home directories
lib   - contains the libraries 32 and 64 bit
media - contains the media files, this is where the os will mount stuff like usb
mnt   - contains the mount points, manually mount stuff here
opt   - contains the optional files
proc  - contains the process information
root  - contains the root directory for the root user
tmp   - contains the temporary files
usr   - contains the user files
var   - contains the variable files, E.G logs

/usr contains the following subdirectories:
bin     - contains the user binaries
include - contains the header files
lib     - contains the user libraries
local   - contains the local files
share   - contains the shared files
src     - contains the source files
