Max os following: [OS Dev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Creating_an_Operating_System), [YouTube WYOOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4&list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M&ab_channel=WriteyourownOperatingSystem')

This is a hobby OS developed in mainly C++, the aim of this project is to setup a functional operating system that supports programs, has a GUI and is POSIX compatible. 

In the future I aim to have it run on a raspberry PI, include its very own in house web browser and a custom game engine.

The codebase is well commented with additional notes in the docs directory. Contribution is welcome, however it would be ideal once the basics are set up and I begin on the extended features. (See projects)

Now with custom build toolchain (binutils, gcc, g++, make, etc) and a custom that can optionally be installed via the make_toolchain.sh file located in toolcahin. The OS can be built using this (build_via_tc.sh) or built via the make file (see below.) The toolchain will become more mainstream with the release of the c libraries.
